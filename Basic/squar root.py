# Python Program to calculate the square root

# Note: change this value for a different result
num = 8 

# To take the input from the user
#num = float(input('Enter a number: '))

num_sqrt = num ** 0.5
print('The square root of %0.3f is %0.3f'%(num ,num_sqrt))

# There can be alternate way to find out the square root of a number 
# from math import sqrt
#sqrt() function take a time complexity of O(log n) it is more effecient while dealing with large number
# num_sqrt = sqrt(num)
